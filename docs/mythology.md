### **Methodology Section: A Step-by-Step Plan**

This section outlines the comprehensive methodology to be employed in this research, detailing the systematic approach to achieve the stated objectives. The proposed framework integrates a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-guided Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) for global path planning with the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) for local reactive control. This hybrid architecture aims to address the limitations of traditional navigation algorithms in dynamic and partially known environments, enhancing efficiency, robustness, and safety in autonomous robot navigation.

### **1. Overall Research Approach: Hybrid Planning Architecture**

The core of this research revolves around developing and evaluating a novel hybrid planning architecture. This architecture synergistically combines the global foresight and path optimality potential of a PRM-based planner with the real-time reactivity and kinematic feasibility of a DWA-based local controller. The key innovation lies in leveraging a Deep Neural Network to intelligently guide the sampling process of the PRM, thereby improving its computational efficiency, particularly in complex and constrained environments. The DWA then utilizes the globally planned path as a reference, ensuring smooth, collision-free, and kinematically feasible execution in dynamic scenarios.

This approach is chosen to capitalize on the strengths of both deliberative (global) and reactive (local) planning paradigms while mitigating their individual weaknesses. The DNN-guided PRM is expected to overcome the computational bottlenecks of traditional PRM by focusing sampling efforts on high-utility regions, while DWA provides the necessary agility to handle unforeseen obstacles and dynamic changes in the immediate environment. The entire system will be developed and rigorously evaluated within a comprehensive simulation framework, allowing for controlled experimentation and quantitative performance assessment against established baselines.

### **2. Detailed Methodological Steps per Specific Objective**

Each specific objective of this thesis necessitates a distinct set of methodological steps, carefully designed to contribute to the overall research goal. These steps are outlined below, providing a clear roadmap for the implementation and evaluation phases of the project.

#### **2.1. Objective 1: Develop and Train a DNN for Sampling Guidance**
This objective focuses on the creation and optimization of the intelligent component that enhances the PRM's efficiency. The methodology for this objective involves three critical sub-steps:

**2.1.1. Data Generation for DNN Training**
To effectively train a Deep Neural Network to guide PRM sampling, a diverse and representative dataset is paramount. This dataset will consist of 2D environment representations (occupancy grids) paired with corresponding high-utility sampling regions. The process will involve:

*   **Environment Generation:** A variety of 2D environments will be programmatically generated, encompassing different complexities such as open spaces, cluttered areas, narrow passages, and environments with static obstacles. These environments will simulate real-world scenarios relevant to autonomous robot navigation, such as warehouses, urban landscapes, or indoor settings. The generation process will ensure sufficient diversity to prevent overfitting and promote generalization of the DNN model.
*   **Ground Truth Generation (High-Utility Sampling Regions):** For each generated environment, the 'ground truth' for high-utility sampling regions will be identified. This can be achieved through several approaches:
    *   **Expert Knowledge/Heuristics:** Initial identification of critical areas (e.g., bottlenecks, intersections, areas near obstacles) based on expert understanding of PRM behavior and connectivity requirements. This can involve manual annotation or rule-based algorithms.
    *   **Exhaustive PRM Runs:** Running a traditional PRM with a very high number of samples in each environment and analyzing the distribution of samples that contribute to successful pathfinding. Regions with a higher density of successful samples would be designated as high-utility.
    *   **Graph Connectivity Analysis:** Analyzing the connectivity of the roadmap generated by traditional PRM. Regions that are critical for connecting different components of the free space, or those that bridge disconnected regions, would be considered high-utility. Techniques like graph centrality measures could be employed.
*   **Data Representation:** The generated environments will be represented as occupancy grids. The high-utility sampling regions will be represented as probability maps or heatmaps, indicating the likelihood of a sample being useful in that region. This format is suitable for input and output of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.

**2.1.2. DNN Architecture Selection and Training**
The selection of an appropriate DNN architecture is crucial for effectively mapping occupancy grids to sampling probability distributions. Potential architectures include:

*   **U-Net:** A convolutional network architecture whose U-shaped architecture with skip connections allows it to capture both local and global context, making it suitable for generating dense prediction maps like probability distributions.
*   **ResNet-FPN (Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet backbone):** This combination can be effective for capturing features at various resolutions within the occupancy grid.
*   **ViT (Vision Transformer):** While traditionally used for image classification, Vision Transformers have shown promising results. Adapting a ViT for dense prediction tasks might involve using a decoder similar to those in semantic segmentation models.

**Training Methodology:**
*   **Loss Function:** A suitable loss function will be chosen to optimize the DNN. Common choices include:
    *   **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss:** If the high-utility regions are treated as a binary classification problem (useful/not useful).
    *   **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence:** If the output is a probability distribution, KL divergence can measure the difference between the predicted and ground truth distributions.
*   **Optimization:** Standard optimization algorithms such as Adam or SGD with momentum will be employed. Learning rate schedules will be used to ensure stable and efficient training.
*   **Regularization:** Techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and L2 regularization will be applied to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.
*   **Hardware:** Training will be conducted on GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA A100, V100) to accelerate the computational process.

**2.1.3. Optimization for Efficient Inference**
For real-time robot navigation, the trained DNN model must be optimized for efficient inference on robotic platforms. This involves:

*   **Model Quantization:** Reducing the precision of the model's weights and activations to decrease memory footprint and accelerate computation.
*   **Model Pruning:** Removing redundant or less important connections/neurons from the network to reduce model size and computational load.
*   **Hardware-Aware Optimization:** Utilizing specialized libraries and frameworks (e.g., TensorRT, OpenVINO) that optimize model execution for specific hardware architectures.
*   **Batching:** Processing multiple occupancy grids simultaneously to leverage parallel processing capabilities of GPUs.

#### **2.2. Objective 2: Integrate DNN Guidance into PRM**
This objective focuses on incorporating the trained DNN model into the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) algorithm to enhance its sampling efficiency and overall performance.

*   **Guided Sampling Strategy:** New configurations (nodes) for the PRM roadmap will be sampled probabilistically based on the output of the DNN. This targeted sampling is expected to significantly reduce the number of samples required.
*   **Collision Checking:** For each sampled configuration, a collision check will be performed to ensure that the sampled point is in the free space.

**2.2.2. Adaptive Sampling Strategy for Connectivity and Coverage**
An adaptive sampling strategy is crucial to ensure comprehensive coverage and robust connectivity of the roadmap. This involves:

*   **Hybrid Sampling:** A hybrid approach combining DNN-guided sampling with a small percentage of uniform random sampling to provide a fallback mechanism.
*   **Connectivity-Driven Sampling:** Monitoring the connectivity of the PRM graph and strategically generating additional samples in the vicinity of disconnected components to bridge the gaps.
*   **Coverage-Driven Sampling:** Ensuring that the entire free space is adequately covered by identifying uncovered cells and preferentially generating new samples in these regions.

**2.2.3. PRM Graph Construction and Path Search with Smoothing**
Once nodes are sampled, the PRM graph is constructed and a path is found and smoothed. This involves:

*   **Graph Construction:** For each sampled node, connections (edges) will be attempted to its k-nearest neighbors. An edge is added if the straight line path between the two nodes is collision-free.
*   **Efficient Path Search (A\*):** A path will be found using an efficient graph search algorithm like A\*.
*   **Path Smoothing:** The jagged path will be smoothed to generate a more continuous and kinematically feasible trajectory using techniques such as:
    *   **B-spline or Cubic Spline Interpolation:** Fitting a smooth curve through the waypoints.
    *   **Shortcutting:** Iteratively connecting non-adjacent nodes in the path with a straight line if the segment is collision-free.
    *   **Optimization-based Smoothing:** Formulating path smoothing as an optimization problem to minimize path length and curvature while maximizing clearance.

    *   **Obstacle Clearance:** A term that maximizes the distance to the closest obstacle.
    *   **Velocity/Speed:** A term that encourages higher velocities to promote efficient navigation.
    *   **Path Following (for hybrid integration):** A new component to ensure the DWA closely follows the global path from the PRM.
*   **Parameter Tuning:** The weights of the cost function and other DWA parameters will be systematically tuned through:
    *   **Grid Search/Random Search:** Exploring a range of parameter values in simulation.
    *   **Optimization Algorithms:** Employing techniques like Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms to automatically find optimal parameter sets.
    *   **Empirical Tuning:** Iterative manual adjustment of parameters based on observed behavior.

**2.3.3. Integration of Mechanisms for Handling Local Dynamic Obstacles**
The implementation will include specific mechanisms to handle dynamic obstacles:

*   **Dynamic Obstacle Prediction:** Incorporating simple prediction models (e.g., constant velocity model) to improve anticipatory capabilities.
*   **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Consideration:** Augmenting the cost function to penalize trajectories with a low time-to-collision.
*   **Prioritization of Avoidance:** Ensuring obstacle avoidance takes precedence over path following when a collision is imminent.

#### **2.4. Objective 4: Integrate the Global and Local Planners**
This objective focuses on seamlessly integrating the DNN-guided PRM global planner with the DWA local planner.

**2.4.1. Hierarchical Control Architecture Development**
The integration will be achieved through a hierarchical control architecture. This will involve:

*   **Coordinate Transformation and Synchronization:** Ensuring seamless communication and data exchange between the global and local planning layers.
*   **State Machine for Navigation:** Implementing a state machine to manage transitions between different navigation states (e.g., following global path, obstacle avoidance, replanning).

**2.4.2. Robust Replanning Logic and Recovery Behaviors**
Mechanisms will be developed to handle unforeseen circumstances gracefully:

*   **Trigger Conditions for Replanning:** Defining clear criteria that trigger a global replanning event, such as:
    *   Significant deviation from the global path.
    *   Detection of unforeseen, persistent obstacles.
    *   Planner failure or timeout.
    *   Significant dynamic changes in the environment.
*   **Replanning Strategy:** When triggered, the system will initiate a new global path planning request from the robot's current position.
*   **Recovery Behaviors:** Implementing specific behaviors for situations where replanning is not sufficient, such as:
    *   **Stop and Wait:** If the robot encounters an insurmountable obstacle, it will stop safely.
    *   **Backtracking/Local Exploration:** If stuck in a local minimum, the robot might backtrack or perform a limited local search.
    *   **Emergency Braking:** In case of imminent collision, an emergency braking mechanism will override all other controls.
